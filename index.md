# About Me 👨‍💻

I'm a full stack developer with over 20 years in the tech industry. I've learned a lot on my own and have kept up with new technology since the early 2000s.

Since 2015, I've been a Senior Engineer @ [The Agile Monkeys](https://www.theagilemonkeys.com/) 🐵, working well in teams that value new ideas and teamwork. I'm good at both front-end and back-end work, and I make applications that are easy to use and make customers happy.

I've worked on many projects, using different programming languages, frameworks, and tools. I can switch between various technologies easily, making sure everything runs smoothly and grows.

I'm great at solving problems and pay attention to the little things, which helps me fix complicated issues. I'm also good at talking and working with different people, which makes for a positive workplace.

My love for my work, commitment, and ability to adapt have helped me grow and succeed. I'm always looking to learn about new tech and take on new challenges, as they inspire me to innovate.

In my spare time, I like to practice surfing 🏄‍♂️, skateboarding 🛹 and play music on vinyl.
